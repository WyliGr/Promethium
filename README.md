# Promethium

This repo is an Open-Source and Open-Data API for the Periodic Table of Elements built with FastAPI and Docker.
This was not *really* made for production use, but rather as a learning project to explore FastAPI and entertain me during an insomnia. You can still selfhost it if needed though!
